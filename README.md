# Installation

Download and unzip the skin to ``~/skins/`` folder
or let this script do it for you (run from GameShell):
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domichal/GameSH-etc/master/install-greey-skin.sh | bash
```

# Credits
- Tool and Snake graphics used on Launcher Tools Icon were made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com
- Majority of the icons come from [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Mzfms2wlOR9l4c7OgP1GhNd5/GameShell?node-id=102%3A486) That I believe were made by this man [here](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/editable-icons-project-fixing-and-expanding-the-default-themes-icons/2812/7)
- Modified graphics from clockworkpi launchers were also used
